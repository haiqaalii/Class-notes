What is Bash Scripting?
A bash script is a plain which contains a series of commands to be exucuted by the Bash Shell. it allows users to
automate and perform a series of commands without having to maunally enter them.

Steps to Writing a bash Script:
1. Create a text file and make it end with .sh extension. Example: Bashscript.sh
2. Start the script with the shebang to specify the interperter. Example: #!/bin/bash
3. Type out the commands just like they would be typed out in a terminal.

Using variables in Bash Script Example:

#!/bin/bash
# Defining variables

NAME="Alice"
echo "Hello, $NAME!"

Example of a Bash Script:

#!/bin/bash
# A simple Bash script

echo "Hello, World!"

Instructions for creating a Test script:

#!/bin/bash
# Script to check if a directory exists and create it if not

echo "Enter directory name: "
read DIR

if [ -d "$DIR" ]; then
  echo "Directory $DIR already exists."
else
  echo "Directory $DIR does not exist. Creating it now."
  mkdir "$DIR"
  echo "Directory $DIR created."
fi

How this Bash Script works?
1. The script asks the user for a directory name.
2. It checks if the directory exists with [ -d "$DIR" ].
3. If the directory exists, it prints a message. If not, it creates the directory using mkdir.
